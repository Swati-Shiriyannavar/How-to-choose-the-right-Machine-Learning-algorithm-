Before you start thinking about the different algorithms, you need to familiarize yourself with your data. 
It is usually recommended to gather a good amount of data to get reliable predictions. 
A simple way to do that is to analyze the data and try to find trends within it, and, most importantly of all, its size. 

 

Small Dataset: if the dataset is smaller or contains fewer observations then implement algorithms with High Bias/ Low Variance.  
For example, Linear regression, Na√Øve Bayes, or Linear SVM. 

Large Dataset: if the dataset is larger or contains comparatively more observations then implement algorithms with Low Bias/ High Variance.  
For example, KNN, Decision trees, Random Forest or kernel SVM.
